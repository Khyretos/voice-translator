"""
Persistent session-slug resolution.

A "slug" is the persistent, human-meaningful session identity — e.g. the
`khyretos` in `https://host/khyretos` (via reverse-proxy rewrite, see
SESSIONS.md) or `https://host/?session=khyretos`. Each slug maps to exactly
one VoiceTranslatorApp and one settings file, so re-opening the same URL —
in a new tab, after a reload, after a network blip — always re-attaches to
the same session instead of creating a new one.

See SESSIONS.md for the full design writeup.

## Why this isn't cookie-based anymore

The first version of this module used a cookie to remember the slug across
requests. That's broken for the actual use case: cookies are shared across
*every tab* of the same browser, not scoped to one tab. Opening "khyretos"
in one tab and "discord" in another meant whichever tab loaded most
recently overwrote the *one* shared cookie for the whole browser — so both
tabs' subsequent clicks (which don't carry the original page's query
string; that's a real Gradio limitation, not something we can fix here)
silently resolved to whichever slug's cookie happened to be current. That's
the "Already running" / wrong-session-name-in-title bug.

The fix: Gradio already hands every event handler a `request.session_hash`
that's stable for the lifetime of one tab's connection — that's how Gradio
itself routes queue events back to the right client, so it was never the
unreliable part. What *is* reliable per-tab is `sessionStorage` in the
browser (unlike cookies/localStorage, it's genuinely per-tab). So: resolve
the slug once, client-side, from `window.location` / `sessionStorage` at
page load (see the JS in voice_translator.py's handle_ui_load wiring),
register it against that tab's `session_hash` here, and every later
`get_slug(request)` call for the rest of that tab's life is just a dict
lookup — accurate, and it doesn't touch any of the other ~25 event handlers
that call get_slug(request) at all.
