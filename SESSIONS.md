# Persistent named sessions (Phase 1)

## What changed

Previously each browser tab got a random, ephemeral `session_hash` from
Gradio that was thrown away (along with all running recognition state) the
moment the tab reloaded or the connection blipped — the UI even said
*"Each tab = separate session • Refresh = new session"*. That was by design,
but it meant:

- There was no way to return to "the same" session later.
- All settings were saved to a single global `settings.json` — one shared
  config for every tab/session.
- `settings.json` was never mounted as a Docker volume, so it was silently
  lost on every container restart or rebuild anyway.
- Any WebSocket hiccup, or the tab losing focus/being backgrounded, tore the
  whole session down (`close_session`), which — combined with a
  `timeout_keep_alive=0` typo in the uvicorn config (see below) — is the
  most likely explanation for "sessions randomly refresh."

## What it does now

Each browser tab's slug is resolved **client-side**, once, at page load —
by JavaScript reading the `?session=` query string, or (if absent)
`sessionStorage` (a value it stores itself, purely to survive a reload of
*that specific tab* — unlike cookies or `localStorage`, `sessionStorage` is
genuinely scoped to one tab, never shared with any other tab in the same
browser), falling back to `DEFAULT_SLUG` (`"main"`) for a completely fresh
visit. That value gets registered against Gradio's own `request.session_hash`
— which is already stable for the lifetime of one tab's connection, since
that's literally how Gradio itself routes queue events back to the right
client — and every other event handler in that tab looks the slug up from
that registration for the rest of the tab's life. See `session.py`'s module
docstring for the full mechanism.

### Bug: sessions bleeding into each other across tabs (cookie-based design)

An earlier version of this resolved the slug server-side using a cookie.
That's broken for the actual use case: **cookies are shared across every
tab of the same browser**, not scoped to one tab. Opening `khyretos` in one
tab and `discord` in another meant whichever tab loaded most recently
overwrote the one shared cookie for the *entire browser* — so both tabs'
subsequent clicks (Start, Stop, settings changes — none of which carry the
original page's query string on their own; that's a real Gradio queue
limitation, not something fixable at the app layer) silently resolved to
whichever slug's cookie happened to be current at that moment. Symptoms:
"Already running — press Stop first" when starting a *different* session
that was never actually started, the session title in one tab suddenly
showing another tab's name, and closing a session from the "Manage
Sessions" dropdown not doing anything (because `current` was resolving to
the wrong tab's identity, throwing off which entries got excluded/matched).

Fixed by moving off cookies entirely, to the `sessionStorage` + `session_hash`
registry design described above — genuinely per-tab by construction, so two
tabs with two different session names can never leak into each other again.

### Bug: `Session: gradio_api`

If you saw a session literally named `gradio_api` on first load, that was a
real bug, now fixed. Modern Gradio (5.x/6.x) namespaces essentially all of
its internal traffic — the queue, config, file serving, MCP, etc. — under a
single `/gradio_api/...` path prefix. `RESERVED_PATH_SEGMENTS` was built
assuming older Gradio's bare top-level paths (`/queue`, `/config`,
`/file=...`) and didn't know about this prefix, so some internal Gradio
request to a path like `/gradio_api/queue/join` got its first path segment
("gradio_api") treated as if it were a user-chosen slug. Fixed by adding
`"gradio_api"` to the reserved list; the cookie-poisoning consequence this
originally had is moot now that slugs aren't cookie-based at all.

### Opening / creating a session from the UI

There's a "session switcher" in the header: a name field + **Go**
button (navigates to `?session=<name>`, sanitized client-side and again on
the server) and a **New** button (jumps to a fresh randomly-named session).
Previously the only way to open a named session was to already know you
could edit the URL by hand.

The resolved slug is stored in that tab's `sessionStorage`, so it survives
a reload of *that tab* without needing to retype the URL — this is also
what makes multi-tab correct: `sessionStorage` is never shared with other
tabs, unlike a cookie.

Each slug maps to exactly one `VoiceTranslatorApp` and one settings file
(`settings/<slug>.json`). Opening the same URL in a new tab (or the same
tab, after a reload) re-attaches to the *same* running session — same
settings, same in-progress recognition — instead of creating a new one.
Opening it from an entirely different browser/device also re-attaches to
the same session (settings are looked up by slug, not tied to any one
browser) — it just won't share that other browser's `sessionStorage`
convenience, so you'd need to include `?session=<name>` in the URL there.

A tab closing/reloading no longer destroys anything. Sessions are permanent
by design: nothing in this app ever automatically stops or tears down a
session that's actively listening (`is_running`/`is_monitoring`), no matter
how long it runs or how much silence there is — silence is handled by the
VAD simply producing no segments, it never touches the session itself. The
only things that stop a session:
- You press Stop, or explicitly close it from the "Manage Sessions" panel.
- An optional, **off-by-default** idle reaper that only ever considers
  *stopped* sessions (recognition already off) left completely untouched
  for `IDLE_SESSION_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` — 0 means disabled. It never closes a
  running session under any circumstance. See `docker-compose.yml` to
  opt in if you want stopped-and-abandoned sessions to free memory.

## Using it

- **Query string (works everywhere, no proxy config needed):**
  `https://voice-translator.kreative-kompas.com/?session=khyretos`
- **Pretty path** (`https://.../khyretos`) — needs a rewrite at your nginx
  reverse proxy, since routing that at the Python/FastAPI layer risks
  shadowing Gradio's own top-level routes (`/config`, `/assets`, etc.) if a
  future Gradio version adds a new one we didn't know to exclude. Add this
  to your `nginx-reverse-proxy` config for the voice-translator vhost,
  *above* your default `location /` block:

  ```nginx
  # Rewrite /<name> to /?session=<name>, but only for single-segment paths
  # that aren't one of Gradio's own reserved routes.
  location ~ ^/(?!config$|info$|login$|logout$|reset$|queue|static|assets|file|upload|stream|proxy|component_server|custom_component|theme\.css$|manifest\.json$|robots\.txt$|startup-events$|heartbeat$|ws|popout|mic_level|display_data|logs_data|deactivate|fonts|active_sessions$|favicon\.ico$)([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)/?$ {
      proxy_pass http://voice-translator:7860/?session=$1;
      proxy_set_header Host $host;
      proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
      proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
  }
  ```

  Keep this list in sync with `RESERVED_PATH_SEGMENTS` in
  `session.py` if you ever change it.

## Migration

Nothing to do manually. The first time a *new* slug loads with no settings
file of its own yet, it seeds itself from the legacy `settings.json` if one
exists (so your current tuned settings carry over into your first named
session). After that, each slug saves independently to
`settings/<slug>.json`.

## Other fixes bundled with this phase

- **`timeout_keep_alive=0`** in the final `uvicorn.run(...)` call was almost
  certainly a bug — the comment next to it said "1 hour" but the value was
  `0`, which tells uvicorn to close keep-alive connections almost
  immediately. This is a very plausible root cause of the random-refresh
  symptom by itself, independent of the session-teardown issue above. Fixed
  to `3600`.
- WebSocket disconnects (tab closed, "stop streaming" clicked, brief network
  drop) no longer call `close_session` — they just stop feeding audio in.

## Round 2: "the mic just stops", sessions that never stop, popout id lost

### The mic stream stopping after a "refresh"

Three separate causes, all fixed:

- **Gradio's `unload` isn't only "tab closed".** Gradio fires it whenever
  the tab's heartbeat connection drops — a Wi-Fi blip, the laptop waking
  from sleep, a reverse proxy recycling the connection. The tab then
  reconnects with the same `session_hash`, but the unload handler had
  already *forgotten* that hash's slug, so `get_slug()` fell back to the
  raw hash: from then on Start/Stop and every settings change went to an
  unnamed ghost session. The mapping is now kept (the registry is bounded
  by size instead), and if a hash is ever unknown (e.g. after a server
  restart) the slug is recovered from the page URL in the `Referer` header
  — the page now always keeps `?session=<name>` in the address bar — and
  otherwise falls back to `main`, never to the raw hash.
- **The display was updated by a `gr.Timer(0.05)`** — 20 Gradio queue
  events per second per tab, through the same connection as every click.
  Anything that slowed that connection built a backlog that made the page
  stall and reconnect. The display, recognized/translated boxes and logs
  are now polled by plain `fetch()` calls to `/display_data` and
  `/logs_data`, outside Gradio's queue.
- **The audio WebSocket never reconnected**, and audio was captured with a
  `ScriptProcessorNode` on the page's main thread. Any socket drop ended
  streaming for good while the server session kept "running". Capture now
  runs in an `AudioWorklet` (its own audio thread) and the socket
  reconnects automatically with backoff. Audio produced while disconnected
  is dropped rather than replayed late.

After a page reload, a running **Browser Microphone** session re-attaches
the mic automatically (if the browser paused audio, the status box asks for
one click anywhere on the page). **Tab/System Audio** can't be re-shared
without you picking the tab again — the status says to press ▶️ Start,
which on a running session simply re-attaches the audio.

Only one tab streams into a session at a time: if you open the same session
in a second tab and start audio there, the first tab is told it was
replaced and stops, instead of both feeding the same recognizer.

### Audio watchdog: no source → session stops

A running session now stops by itself when its audio source is gone,
with the reason shown in the Status box of every open tab:

- **Browser mic unplugged / permission revoked / "Stop sharing" clicked:**
  the page sees its track end and stops the session immediately.
- **Browser audio stops arriving** (tab closed, browser crashed, network
  down for longer than a blip): stopped after *Auto-stop when audio is
  lost* seconds (Audio section, default 8). The page streams continuously,
  silence included, so a silent room doesn't trigger this; a start gets 30 s
  of grace for the permission prompt / screen-share picker.
- **Server Audio Device unplugged:** PortAudio calls back every 30 ms even
  in silence, so no callbacks for 3 s (or the stream going inactive) stops
  the session. One limitation: a device that keeps delivering pure digital
  silence after being unplugged can't be told apart from a virtual/loopback
  device with nothing playing, so that case isn't auto-stopped.

Set the slider to 0 to never auto-stop. This replaces the earlier "nothing
ever stops a running session" rule, which kept sessions alive with no audio
at all.

### Popout id is saved

The popout id is part of the session's saved settings (`popout_id` in
`settings/<slug>.json`), so an OBS browser source URL keeps working across
restarts. Change it by typing in *Custom Popout ID* and pressing Enter or
clicking away; the Status box confirms it was saved. Ids are unique per
session (a new session never inherits `main`'s id, and an id already used by
another session is refused). `/popout/<id>` also works straight after a
server restart, before anyone reopened that session's page — it loads the
session from disk. The popout polls every 150 ms (was 500 ms), and the
Popout URL shown in the UI uses the address you opened the page with
instead of the `0.0.0.0` bind address.
