# Audio sources (Phase 3)

"Audio Mode" (hardware/browser) is now "Audio Source", with four options
(the fourth, **Discord Voice Channel**, is described in
[DISCORD.md](./DISCORD.md)).
None of them are magic — each is a different, real way of getting audio
into the same recognition pipeline, with different capabilities/limits.

## 1. Server Audio Device (was "hardware")

Unchanged mechanically: the server opens an input stream on whichever
device you pick in the dropdown, via `sounddevice`/PortAudio, reading from
whatever the container can see through `/dev/snd`.

**This already supports "any source" today** — the dropdown lists *every*
input-capable device `sounddevice` finds, which includes virtual/loopback
devices, not just physical mics. If you want to translate a desktop app's
output (Discord's desktop client, Spotify, etc.), route that app's audio
into a virtual input device on the host, then pick that device here. A
couple of common ways to do that:

- **Linux (PulseAudio/PipeWire), most common for a Docker host:**
  ```bash
  # Create a virtual sink, and a virtual mic that's fed by its monitor
  pactl load-module module-null-sink sink_name=discord_capture
  pactl load-module module-remap-source \
      master=discord_capture.monitor source_name=discord_mic
  ```
  Then set Discord's output device to `discord_capture`, and this app's
  input to `discord_mic` (it'll show up in the dropdown as a normal input
  device — no code change needed). This container already mounts
  `/dev/snd:/dev/snd`; if it's not seeing PulseAudio-level devices (only
  raw ALSA hardware), you'll additionally need to share the PulseAudio
  socket into the container (bind-mount `/run/user/<uid>/pulse` and set
  `PULSE_SERVER`), which is a docker-compose change, not an app change —
  ask if you want that wired up.
- **Windows:** a virtual cable like VB-Audio Virtual Cable. Set Discord's
  output to the virtual cable, then run this app on the host (not
  necessarily in Docker, since USB/audio passthrough into Windows
  containers is a much bigger lift) and pick the virtual cable as input.
- **macOS:** BlackHole or Loopback, same idea.

This is host/OS audio routing, not something the Python app can do for you
— but once it's set up, the app sees it as just another input device.

## 2. Browser Microphone (was "browser")

Unchanged: `getUserMedia({ audio: true })` — this device's default
microphone, streamed to the server over the existing WebSocket. No device
picker (that's a Web Audio API limitation — a Chrome/Firefox permission
prompt gives you *a* mic, not a list to choose from, unless you request
`enumerateDevices()` + a `deviceId` constraint; ask if you want that added).

## 3. Browser Tab / System Audio (new)

Uses `getDisplayMedia({ video: true, audio: true })` — the same API behind
screen-sharing — and discards the video track immediately, keeping only the
audio. When you press Start (or Test Mic) in this mode, the browser shows
its native share picker; you choose a **tab**, **window**, or **entire
screen**, and must check **"Share audio"** (called "Share tab audio" for a
tab share) or the stream will have no audio track and the app will show an
error.

**What you can actually capture this way depends on your browser/OS** —
this is a browser/OS sandboxing limit, not something server code can work
around:

| Sharing... | Chrome/Edge (Win/Linux/ChromeOS) | Chrome/Edge (macOS) | Firefox | Safari |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| A browser tab's audio | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ (per-tab) | ❌ |
| Entire screen / system audio | ✅ | ❌ (OS blocks it) | ❌ | ❌ |

So: **Discord running in a browser tab** (`discord.com`) → share that tab
with audio → works everywhere Chromium does. **Discord's desktop app** is
not a browser tab, so it can only be captured this way via "entire screen"
system audio, which is Windows/ChromeOS-only in Chrome/Edge. On macOS,
route the desktop app through a virtual device instead (see option 1).

## Settings migration

Old saved `audio_mode: "browser"` is automatically migrated to
`"browser_mic"` on load — no action needed.

## 4. Discord Voice Channel

A bot joins the Discord voice channel you're in and receives each person's
audio separately, so every speaker is captioned on their own row with their
avatar and name — no need to route Discord's audio through a virtual device
at all. See [DISCORD.md](./DISCORD.md).

## When a source goes away

Whatever the source, a running session stops by itself when its audio is
really gone — a server device unplugged, a browser mic disconnected, tab
sharing stopped, the tab closed, or (Discord) you leaving the voice channel.
The reason is shown in the Status box. Silence never counts as "gone". The
delay is **Auto-stop when audio is lost** in the Audio settings (0 = never).
See [SESSIONS.md](./SESSIONS.md).

Server devices that can't record at 16 kHz ("Invalid sample rate
[PaErrorCode -9997]") are opened at their own rate and resampled
automatically (`audio_input.py`).
